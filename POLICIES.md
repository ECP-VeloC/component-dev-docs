# Policies

This document details various policies that relate to all components.

## Repository Access

To quickly grant access to all repositories in the ECP-Veloc organization, members of the org can be added to the [Developers team](https://github.com/orgs/ECP-VeloC/teams).
This team grants "maintainer" permissions to its members.

## Code of Conduct and Contributing Guide

Each component repository includes a copy of the SCR/VELOC community [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). These files are included here and should be identical in all component repositories.
